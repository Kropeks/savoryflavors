# SavoryFlavors Database Enhancement Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the comprehensive enhancements made to the SavoryFlavors recipe management system database. The enhancements include advanced favorites management, automatic rating calculations, data validation, audit trails, and much more.

## Files Created

1. **`database_schema_enhanced.sql`** - Complete enhanced database schema with all new features
2. **`database_enhancement_script.sql`** - SQL script to apply enhancements to existing database
3. **`database_constraints_validation.sql`** - Additional constraints and validation rules

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Favorites System

The enhanced favorites system now includes:

- **Categories**: Organize favorites into custom categories (Quick Meals, Healthy Options, Date Night, etc.)
- **Priority Levels**: Mark favorites as low, medium, or high priority
- **Notes**: Add personal notes to favorites
- **Tags**: Add custom tags for better organization
- **View Tracking**: Track how often you view favorite recipes
- **Pinning**: Pin important favorites for quick access

#### New Tables:
- `favorite_categories` - Custom categories for organizing favorites
- Enhanced `user_favorites` table with new fields

### 2. Automatic Rating Calculations

Database triggers automatically update recipe ratings when:
- New reviews are added
- Existing reviews are updated
- Reviews are deleted
- Favorites are added/removed

### 3. Data Validation & Constraints

Comprehensive check constraints ensure data integrity:
- Email format validation
- Positive value constraints
- Length limits for text fields
- Rating range validation (1-5)
- Energy/satisfaction level validation (1-10)

### 4. Soft Delete Functionality

Key tables now support soft deletion:
- `users` table with `is_active` and `deleted_at` columns
- `recipes` table with soft delete capability
- `recipe_reviews` table with soft delete support

### 5. Enhanced Indexing

Performance-optimized indexes for common queries:
- Search indexes for recipes
- Composite indexes for filtering
- User activity indexes
- Date-based indexes for time-series queries

### 6. Audit Trail System

Track all changes to important data:
- `audit_trail` table logs INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- Tracks user actions, IP addresses, and timestamps
- Helps with debugging and compliance

### 7. Recipe Sharing & Collaboration

New features for sharing recipes:
- `recipe_shares` table for sharing recipes with other users
- Permission levels (view, edit, admin)
- Share messages and acceptance tracking

### 8. Meal Planning

Enhanced meal planning capabilities:
- `meal_plans` table for creating meal plans
- `meal_plan_recipes` table for assigning recipes to specific dates
- Track nutritional goals and progress

### 9. Social Features

User interaction features:
- `user_follows` table for following other users
- `notifications` table for system notifications
- Achievement and badge system

### 10. Enhanced Views and Stored Procedures

Pre-built database views and procedures:
- `active_recipes` - View of all active recipes
- `recipe_stats` - Comprehensive recipe statistics
- `user_activity_summary` - User engagement metrics
- `nutrition_summary` - Nutritional intake summaries

## Installation Instructions

### For New Installations

1. Run the complete enhanced schema:
```sql
SOURCE database_schema_enhanced.sql;
```

### For Existing Databases

1. Apply the enhancement script:
```sql
SOURCE database_enhancement_script.sql;
```

2. Add validation constraints:
```sql
SOURCE database_constraints_validation.sql;
```

## Database Triggers

The system includes several automatic triggers:

1. **Recipe Rating Updates**: Automatically recalculates ratings when reviews change
2. **Favorite Count Updates**: Updates favorite counts when users favorite/unfavorite recipes
3. **User Food Rating Updates**: Updates ratings for user-created foods

## New API Endpoints Needed

To fully utilize these enhancements, consider adding these API endpoints:

### Favorites Management
- `GET /api/favorites` - Get user's favorites with filtering
- `POST /api/favorites/{recipeId}/categories` - Add to category
- `PUT /api/favorites/{recipeId}` - Update favorite metadata
- `DELETE /api/favorites/{recipeId}` - Remove from favorites

### Recipe Sharing
- `POST /api/recipes/{recipeId}/share` - Share recipe with user
- `GET /api/recipes/shared-with-me` - Get shared recipes
- `PUT /api/shares/{shareId}/accept` - Accept shared recipe

### Meal Planning
- `POST /api/meal-plans` - Create new meal plan
- `POST /api/meal-plans/{planId}/recipes` - Add recipe to meal plan
- `GET /api/meal-plans/{planId}/schedule` - Get meal plan schedule

### Social Features
- `POST /api/users/{userId}/follow` - Follow user
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get user notifications
- `PUT /api/notifications/{notificationId}/read` - Mark as read

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Added
- Full-text search indexes for recipe searching
- Composite indexes for common filter combinations
- Date-based indexes for time-series queries
- User-specific indexes for personalization

### Query Optimization
- Use the provided views for complex queries
- Leverage stored procedures for common operations
- Consider partitioning large tables by date

## Data Migration Notes

### Existing Favorites Migration
The enhancement script includes a stored procedure to migrate existing favorites to the new category system. It will randomly assign categories for demonstration purposes.

### Review Data Migration
Existing reviews will automatically get the new fields with default values:
- `helpful_votes` and `total_votes` default to 0
- `is_active` defaults to TRUE
- `is_verified_purchase` defaults to FALSE

## Security Enhancements

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated at the database level
2. **Audit Trail**: All changes are logged for security monitoring
3. **Soft Delete**: Prevents accidental data loss
4. **Permission System**: Recipe sharing with granular permissions

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Monitor the audit trail for suspicious activity
2. Clean up old notification records periodically
3. Archive old meal entries for performance
4. Update user achievement progress regularly

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor index usage with `SHOW INDEX_STATISTICS`
- Check slow queries with `SHOW PROCESSLIST`
- Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze query performance

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further development:
1. Recipe versioning system
2. Advanced nutritional analysis
3. Meal plan optimization algorithms
4. Social recipe recommendations
5. Integration with fitness tracking devices
6. Advanced search with AI-powered suggestions
